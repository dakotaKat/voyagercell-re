the "good running config"

three networks at play here:

vSwitch 1, the LTE Core LAN
 192.168.20.0/24

the eNodeB sits at .20, Raemis sits at .55 via one NIC static.
eNodeB connects physically in the unit to Ethernet 0/3.

vSwitch 2, the AppUser LAN
 192.168.1.0/24

this network hosts the front-end for Raemis, the VoyagerCell for VNC access to VMs, and dumps out all LTE devices into it as clients inside this subnet. basically everyone's LAN.

vSwitch 3, the WAN
 dhcp, connected to Ethernet 0/1.

VMs running:
 core-router
  this is just opnsense as simple as can be: one NIC is on vSwitch 3 to serve WAN, one nic is on vSwitch 2 to serve appuser LAN.

 raemis
  the star of the show

 pbx
  interconnect for VoLTE to the world

WiFi config:
 ssid, wpa2 password, dumps into AppUser LAN.

everything relies on opnsense being up, naturally.
